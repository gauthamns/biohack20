# Idea
An app that trains you to bio-hack your body, to improve the quality of living as per your requirements with easy yet rewarding tasks.

## Additional information
Be it retrofuturism/ cyberpunk future on anything beyond human prediction, CHANGE is inevitable. The world is moving towards biohacking. Our objective is to bridge the gap between wellness and bio-hacking.
